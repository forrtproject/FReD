\title{Convert effect sizes to common metric (r)}
\usage{
convert_effect_sizes(es_values, es_types, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{es_values}{Numeric vector of effect sizes}

\item{es_types}{Character vector of effect size types (types/wordings that are not supported are flagged in warning)}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Should dataset warnings (unknown effect sizes and values not convertible to numeric)
and status messages be suppressed?}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of effect sizes in common metric (r)
}
\description{
Takes vectors of effect sizes and their types and converts them to a common metric (r).
It also converts test statistics (e.g., \emph{t}, \emph{F} with 1 degree of freedom in the numerator,
\emph{z} with \emph{N}, and \eqn{\chi^2} with 1 degree of freedom and \emph{N}) to \emph{r}. Other test statistics cannot be
consistently converted, so are returned as \code{NA}.

Conversion formulas:
\itemize{
\item r: \eqn{r}
\item r^2: \eqn{r = \sqrt{r^2}}
\item d / Cohen's g: \eqn{r = \frac{d}{\sqrt{d^2 + 4}}}
\item odds ratio: \eqn{d = \log(\mathrm{OR}) \cdot \sqrt{3} / \pi}, then \eqn{r = \frac{d}{\sqrt{d^2 + 4}}}
\item eta^2: \eqn{d = 2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\eta}{1 - \eta}}}, then \eqn{r = \frac{d}{\sqrt{d^2 + 4}}}
\item Cohen's f: \eqn{d = 2 \cdot f}, then \eqn{r = \frac{d}{\sqrt{d^2 + 4}}}
\item t(df): \eqn{r = \frac{t}{\sqrt{t^2 + df}}}
\item F(1, df2): convert to t via \eqn{t = \sqrt{F}}, then \eqn{r = \frac{t}{\sqrt{t^2 + df2}}}
\item z with N: \eqn{r = \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + N}}}
\item \eqn{\chi^2}(1, N): \eqn{r = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{N}}}
}

Accepted test statistic formats (case-insensitive, with optional spaces):
\itemize{
\item \code{t(10) = 2.5}
\item \code{F(1, 20) = 4.5} (only where the first df is 1)
\item \verb{z = 2.81, N = 34}
\item \code{χ2(1, N = 12) = 5} or \code{x2(1, N = 12) = 5} (only where the first df is 1)
}
}
\examples{
convert_effect_sizes(
  c("t(10) = 2.5", "F(1, 20) = 4.5", "z = 2.81, N = 34", "χ2(1, N = 12) = 5"),
  rep("test statistic", 4)
