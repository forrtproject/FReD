## Welcome to the FReD Reference Annotator

The FReD Reference Annotator can help you annotate any list of references with replication findings. This is intended to make it easier to use replications in teaching and research, and to thus ensure that claims are based on the best available evidence. This is based on the [FORRT Replication Database](https://osf.io/7b3yf/), which is a crowd-sources database covering the social sciences. If you notice that the annotations produced here are missing a replication, please consider [contributing to the database](https://www.soscisurvey.de/replicate/). If you spot any other issue with the data or app, please let us know [on GitHub](https://github.com/forrtproject/FReD/issues) or [by email](mailto::lukas.roeseler@uni-muenster.de).
