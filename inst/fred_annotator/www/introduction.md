## Welcome to the FReD Reference Annotator

The FReD Reference Annotator can help you annotate any list of references with replication findings. This is intended to make it easier to use replications in teaching and research, and to thus ensure that claims are based on the best available evidence. This is based on the <a href='https://osf.io/7b3yf/' target='_blank'>FORRT Replication Database</a>, which is a crowd-sources database covering the social sciences. If you notice that the annotations produced here are missing a replication, please consider <a href='https://www.soscisurvey.de/replicate/' target='_blank'>contributing to the database</a>. If you spot any other issue with the data or app, please let us know <a href='https://github.com/forrtproject/FReD/issues' target='_blank'>on GitHub</a> or <a href='mailto:lukas.roeseler@uni-muenster.de' target='_blank'>by email</a>.

### Step 1: Select references

You can paste a list of references into the text box, or upload a file with references. Currently, only DOIs will be extracted - and then used to search the FORRT Replication Database. You can also directly search the database on the "Study Selection" tab and thereby add and remove studies from the list. If you have a list of references without DOIs, Crossref offers a handy <a href="https://apps.crossref.org/SimpleTextQuery" target = "_blank"> online tool to add DOIs</a>.

### Step 1a: Decide whether to also check for retractions

This app can also check whether any of the references have been retracted, using the Retraction Watch database. As this requires the download of that database from Crossref, it is optional - if you want to add this information, click on the button below the reference upload.

### Step 2: Explore or download reports

Go to the "Report" tab to see visual summaries of replicability across your references, and to view/download an annotated reading list.
