# FReD 0.1.0

## New features
- The Replication Database has merged with the FORRT Reversals & Replications project to become FReD
- The FReD R package now wraps the shiny apps, to facilitate installation and maintenance

## Enhancements
- Further expansion of the dataset
- The package automatically draws on the most recent data, but has an offline mode (`use_FReD_offline()`) that works with a data version included in the package.

## Bug Fixes
- Change user defaults from options to environment variables, so that they are respected in background apps.
